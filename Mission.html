      <p class="content">The mission of the The ACT II Interfaith Center is to 
        help people of all faiths and cultures make and implement positive choices 
        that produce positive outcomes in their lives, and in the lives of others, 
        so that they may thrive spiritually, emotionally and physically. The original 
        mission of ACT II was to coach and counsel those who were living with 
        cancer. Its mission then expanded to helping those with other serious 
        and life-threatening illnesses and their families. Marriage and family 
        relationships became a focus for ACT II as the stresses of illness and 
        disease pressed these critical areas of living and thriving. Coaching 
        pre-marital couples, married couples, stepfamilies and interfaith families 
        followed course naturally after Rev. Rich became ordained.</p>
      <h1>Statement of Principles: </h1>
      <p class="content">We affirm the truth in all faiths and religious paths. 
        The rainbow's beauty consists of its many hues, and the grandeur of a 
        symphony in its many harmonies and colorations. Unity does not mean uniformity.</p>
      <p class="content">We affirm our belief that seeking attunement to Spirit 
        is the highest goal of conscious living. Spiritual living unfolds our 
        inner human possibilities and helps the individual to grow freely toward 
        realizing his or her highest Self. We support and encourage whatever spiritual 
        practices contribute positively to the unique creative growth of every 
        person. </p>
      <p class="content"> We affirm an inclusive vision of &quot;We.&quot; Old 
        dichotomies of &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; do not serve the 
        healing of the world. We experience ourselves as part of the global human 
        family. </p>
      <p class="content"> We affirm the essential goodness of the human being. 
        Each of us is an expression of Divine Nature as we each understand Divinity. 
        As we individually and collectively move toward greater awareness and 
        understanding of Spirit, we become deeper reflections of that Spirit within 
        us and in the world around us. </p>
      <p class="content"> We affirm that each person, indeed all life, is a part 
        of the healing of the world. We have faith in the ultimate healing of 
        the planet. Each of us, as we fulfill our own highest good, brings this 
        healing vision nearer to reality. </p>
      <p class="content"> We affirm the value of Interfaith interactions as enriching 
        our awareness of Spirit in the world. The Interfaith concept, as outlined 
        in these principles, is an unifying vehicle that can aid us in bringing 
        the healing of the world nearer to reality. By working together we walk 
        together toward our common goal: the spiritual awakening of the world.
