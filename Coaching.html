            and the family deal with the challenges and problems of the moment. 
            Coaching programs develop solutions and plan actions that create positive

      <h1>Pre-marriage, Family &amp; Step-family Coaching </h1>
      <p class="content">The Pre-Marriage Coaching program assists the couple 
        in getting their marriage started in a healthy and constructive manner 
        that helps the individuals to grow closer and develop the intimacy that 
        is at the core of the sweetness of marriage. Pre-Marriage coaching is 
        led by Rev. Rich and Patty at The ACT II Interfaith Center exclusively 
        with an individual couple. In the private confidentiality of this setting, 
        any issues that may pose obstacles to the growth of the relationship may 
        be discussed and set on a course of resolution. Rev. Rich and Patty, both 
        members of the International Association of Marriage and Family Counselors 
        strongly recommend a pre-marriage coaching retreat.</p>
      <p class="content">The Step-family Coaching Program is extremely valuable 
        for the couple who are bringing children born out of previous relationship 
        into the marriage. Step-families are quite different than nuclear families, 
        and &#8220;Brady Bunch&#8221; concepts seldom result in positive outcomes. 
        The rules are different and what may seem to be &#8220;common sense&#8221; 
        frequently does not work out for the step-family. This coaching program 
        for both the biological and step-parent is extremely valuable and is conducted 
        in private retreat with Rev. Rich and Patty. </p>
      <p class="content">The Relationship, Family and Step-family Coaching Programs 
        also serve as ongoing support for those who have been coached and married 
        through the ACT II Interfaith program. It is available as well to others 
        who feel that they would benefit from the coaching program. The coaching 
        program deals in an on-going fashion with all the issues that are addressed 
        in the Pre-Marital Coaching Program as well other issues of adult developmental 
        stages and normal life cycle events from child-birth to retirement and 
        aging. </p>

      <p class="content"><strong> </strong> &#8220;Ben and I just wanted to let 
        you know how much we enjoyed this past weekend. We learned a lot about 
        each other and took away new tools and understandings that will help us 
        build a strong marriage. Fondly,&#8221; Chrisie and Ben B. (Virginia Beach).
